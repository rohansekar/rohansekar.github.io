Navigating in cluttered environments presents significant challenges for autonomous systems due to the complex and dynamic nature of the surroundings.In this work, we implement a trajectory-library-based local planner specifically designed for high-speed, non-holonomic autonomous ground robots. Leveraging pre-generated motion primitives derived from the kinematic bicycle model (KBM), our planner is able to adeptly navigate through cluttered environments .
Within our methodology, pre-generated paths are overlaid onto a grid, which is then convolved with the obstacle map to remove paths that run through obstacles.The planner evaluates and scores the remaining trajectories, selecting the optimal path with minimal cost. This approach enables obstacle avoidance and trajectory selection within a timeframe of under 11 milliseconds. 
To validate our approach,we conducted thorough experiments, testing our methodology in simulations using Gazebo and in real-world scenarios with an RC car, to confirm its effectiveness.

**Path Generation**:<br>
The paths were generated using the kinematic bicycle model(KBM) and are kindoynamically feasible paths.

**Correspondence Generation**:<br>

* The generated paths are overlaid on a grid,which is then convolved with the obstacle map for collision checking.
* The robotâ€™s footprint is accounted for in this step.
* This makes the overall process computationally cheap and can run seamlessly on real robots.

**Results and Comparison at Different Speeds :**<br>
The trajectory library outperforms Fast Likelihood-based Collision Avoidance (FALCO) overall in terms of success rate in performance, average directional error, enhancing responsiveness, and average cross-track error.

In terms of success rates,the trajectory library demonstrates superior success rates in executing turns at different speeds compared to FALCO.
