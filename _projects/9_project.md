The primary objective of this task was to design a user interface (UI) for a multi-robot system with various features. The UI needed to handle all possible combinations and scenarios that could arise in both single-robot and multi-robot operations. Our main focus was on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface. We achieved this using the `qt_gui` package from ROS1, which utilizes the Qt framework in Python. The result is demonstrated in the picture below.
