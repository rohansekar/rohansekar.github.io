In the month-long project titled "Race Car Control Optimization and LQR Integration," spanning from October 22 to November 22, our objective was to comprehensively explore control strategies to enhance the performance of a race car in a simulation environment.

In the exploration of control strategies to enhance race car performance within the Webots simulation environment, the project's primary objective was to thoroughly investigate and optimize various approaches.<br>

**Methods:**<br>
Commencing with a comprehensive exploration of state-space analysis and advanced control theory, the project involved meticulous fine-tuning of control parameters based on state-space modeling. This approach aimed to achieve optimal control of the race car by considering crucial dynamics such as position, velocity, and other relevant state variables.


**Results:**<br>
A significant achievement in the project was the successful integration of an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller into the Webots simulation. Renowned for its efficacy in optimizing control systems, the LQR controller proved transformative for the race car's performance. This integration resulted in a substantial improvement, reducing track traversal time by an impressive 2x compared to the initial PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller setup. Despite this notable speed enhancement, the new control system maintained a mean deviation of just 0.48 meters, highlighting precision and stability.

In addition to the LQR controller, the project also implemented State Feedback and Model Predictive controllers, achieving commendable results.

**Discussion:**<br>
The accomplishment underscores the efficacy of advanced control techniques in optimizing race car performance within the Webots simulation environment. The successful integration of the LQR controller, along with other advanced control strategies, has the potential to revolutionize motorsport by significantly enhancing both speed and safety in competitive racing events.

**Conclusion:**<br>
In conclusion, the project's thorough investigation and successful implementation of advanced control strategies demonstrate the potential for transformative advancements in race car control within the Webots simulation environment. The achieved results underscore the precision, stability, and significant performance enhancement offered by these advanced control techniques.
