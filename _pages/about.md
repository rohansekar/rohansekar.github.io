Hi! My name is Rohan Chandrasekar. I am a second-year master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University with a concentration in **Robotics**.My major interests include working Path Planning and Controls for autonomous agents.Currently, I am working in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php),where I work on a multi-agent exploration project,called [MMPUG](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/project/mmpug-multi-model-perception-uber-good/).
